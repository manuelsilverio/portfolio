## What is this?
This project is a Sample of professional work. Here I show apps which are live and sample projects developed to showcase my skills.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* OpenCV
* Jupyter Notebook
* Kotlin
* Java
* C#
* Unity3D

## Web Scraping Projects

#### Scraping Flight info from Kayak - [Link to repo](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/scraping_kayak)
##### Instructions:

* Run example.py for testing code. It will fetch flight info from Milan to Madrid for next day.
* Run scraper_kayak.py for adding your input. You can choose the origin and destination of the scraping. 
* chromedriver.exe must be in the same folder as the python script.
* chrome browser must be installed.

##### Screen capture:
* When running the script, Chrome will open and will look like this:

## OpenCV Projects

#### Mouse control with hand gestures - [Link to repo](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/opencv-finger-tracking)

Finger detection and tracking with OpenCV. Detects and counts fingers. With five fingers it controls the cursor.

## Supervised Learning projects

#### Image Classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks - [click here for more](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier)


A PyTorch Image classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network and Supervised Learning.


* Only one file needed - [ai_image_classifier.py](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier/blob/main/ai_image_classifier.py) -
* you can use it to train a model in three lines of code.
* The model uses a ResNet backbone.

See [example](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier/blob/main/example/example.ipynb) implementing this classifier to distinguish between oranges and pears:

## Reinforcement Learning projects

#### Deep RL Single Agent Bananas collector with Deep Q networks - [Link to repo](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/udacity_project_navigation)
![garbage-collector](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/udacity_project_navigation/blob/main/images/banana-collector.gif)

A training an agent using Deep Q networks to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

This project has been solved on a Jupyter notebook 


#### Deep RL Single Agent Double-joint arm - [Link to repo](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/DeepRL-single-agent-joint-arm)

![agent-double-joint-arm](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/DeepRL-single-agent-joint-arm/blob/main/trained_arms.gif)

Reinforcement Learning Agent for Joint Arm using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

* Training average rewards:

#### Deep RL Multi-agent tennis collaboration/competition - [Link to repo](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/DeepRL-multi-agent-tennis)

![double-agent](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/DeepRL-multi-agent-tennis/blob/main/tennis.gif)

* This repository contains the implementation of a Multi-Agent collaboration using Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG).

* This has been part of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program


## Android apps
	
Android apps live on GooglePlay


#### Belgium Trains

#### Train Catcher - [click here for more](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/train-catcher)

![train_catcher_image](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/train-catcher/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot_01_.png)

* UK Train station boards. Departure and arrival boards for any train station in the UK.

* Train catcher allows you to visualise the departure and arrival boards for any train station in the United Kingdom. It also includes all the calling points between origin and destination. Just select which station you which to see and whether you wish a departure or arrival screen.
