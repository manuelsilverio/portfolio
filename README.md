A training an agent using Deep Q networks to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

This project has been solved on a Jupyter notebook
