## What is this?
This project is a Sample of professional work. Here I show apps which are live and sample projects developed to showcase my skills.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Kotlin
* Java
* C#
* Unity3D

## Supervised Learning projects

### Image Classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks - [click here for more](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier)


A PyTorch Image classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network and Supervised Learning.

See [example](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier/blob/main/example/example.ipynb) implementing this classifier to distinguish between oranges and pears:

#### Bananas collector Agent with Deep Q networks - [click here for more](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/udacity_project_navigation)
![garbage-collector](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/udacity_project_navigation/blob/main/images/banana-collector.gif)

A training an agent using Deep Q networks to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

This project has been solved on a Jupyter notebook

Android App which provide train journey data for Belgium


* Search train routes and connections across, from and to Belgium.

* Fetch train times for all Trains stations and companies within Belgium. Use this app for any rail route query. Find the fastest route from Origin to Destination in Belgium.

* Find all the times and connections from NMBS / SNCB (National rail service of Belgium)

### Train Catcher - [click here for more](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/train-catcher)

![train_catcher_image](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/train-catcher/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot_01_.png)

* UK Train station boards. Departure and arrival boards for any train station in the UK.

* Train catcher allows you to visualise the departure and arrival boards for any train station in the United Kingdom. It also includes all the calling points between origin and destination. Just select which station you which to see and whether you wish a departure or arrival screen.
